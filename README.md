<h2 class="new-section">Racism</h2>
<p>The chapter I will be writing about in the book would be chapter 1. I felt very strongly about this chapter because of the act and acknowledgment of racism to black people from white people. The protagonist in the story is a girl that goes to a Catholic school that is black and one day a white student asked her to move her body around so she could cheat of her. As also stated in the book the black girl would never have a conversation with anyone in the school unless he's spoken to first. So the fact that the white girl is asking her to move her body so she can cheat because she does not want to do tests by herself. This sings very strange because of the fact that she is really never spoken to before, so the black girl moves her body so she can cheat and is obviously doing something you're not supposed to do. The teacher in the classroom never even acknowledge the black girl in general. </p>

<h3 class="new-section">Inequality</h3>
<p>Not only people who are black are racially profiled but people who are Jewish, Chinese, etc. This is a deep habit that is just stupid in my opinion. Not every white person is racist and not only white people are racist. The same thing with people that believe black people are not as intelligent as everyone else or Chinese people are not as smart as
everyone else. Another problem that is someone to racism is woman not being as equal as men.</p>

<h2 class="new-section">Unfair Treatment</h2>

<p3>Think of this, you are judging somebody and treating someone different just because of the skin color. If everyone was the same color, I really would wonder what they were just people on, maybe Heights, wealth, or where you live at or where you're from. This has been going on for centuries and I think this will never end because of the ignorance of the fact.</p3>
